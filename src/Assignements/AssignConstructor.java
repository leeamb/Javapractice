	/*
	 * Assignment 1:
	 * Create a Java class named "Person" with the following instance variables:
	 * name (String)
	 * age (int)
	 * gender (char)
	 * height (double)

	 * Create a constructor for the Person class that takes in the name, age,
	 * gender, and height as parameters and initializes the instance variables.

	 * Create a main method that creates two instances of the Person class using the
	 * constructor and prints out their information.

	 * Assignment 2:
	 * Create a Java class named "Rectangle" with the following instance variables:
	 * length (double)
	 * width (double)

	 * Create a default constructor for the Rectangle class that sets both the
	 * length and width to 0.0.

	 * Create a constructor for the Rectangle class that takes in the length and
	 * width as parameters and initializes the instance variables.

	 * Create a method in the Rectangle class named "calculateArea" that returns the
	 * area of the rectangle (length * width).

	 * Create a main method that creates two instances of the Rectangle class using
	 * both constructors, calculates and prints out their respective areas.

	 * Assignment 3:
	 * 
	 * Create a Java class named "Employee" with the following instance variables:
	 * id (int)
	 * name (String)
	 * salary (double)
	 * Create a constructor for the Employee class that takes in the id, name, and
	 * salary as parameters and initializes the instance variables.
	 * 
	 * Create getter methods for each of the instance variables.
	 * 
	 * Create a main method that creates an instance of the Employee class using the
	 * constructor, prints out the employee's information using the getter methods,
	 * and gives the employee a 10% raise using the setter method for the salary
	 * instance variable.

	 * 
	 * Assignment 4:
	 * 
	 * Create a Java class named "Car" with the following instance variables:
	 * make (String) 
	 * model (String)
	 * year (int)
	 * Create a constructor for the Car class that takes in the make, model, and
	 * year as parameters and initializes the instance variables.
	 * 
	 * Create a default constructor for the Car class that sets the make, model, and
	 * year to "Unknown".
	 * 
	 * Create a main method that creates three instances of the Car class using both
	 * constructors and prints out their information.

	 * Assignment 5:
	 * 
	 * Create a Java class named "BankAccount" with the following instance
	 * variables:
	 * accountNumber (String)
	 * balance (double)
	 * Create a constructor for the BankAccount class that takes in the
	 * accountNumber and balance as parameters and initializes the instance
	 * variables.
	 * 
	 * Create a method in the BankAccount class named "deposit" that takes in a
	 * double value as a parameter and adds it to the balance instance variable.
	 * 
	 * Create a method in the BankAccount class named "withdraw" that takes in a
	 * double value as a parameter and subtracts it from the balance instance
	 * variable.
	 * 
	 * Create a main method that creates an instance of the BankAccount class using
	 * the constructor and performs multiple deposits and withdrawals using the
	 * deposit and withdraw methods. Print out the updated balance after each
	 * transaction.
